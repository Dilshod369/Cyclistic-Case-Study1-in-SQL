# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis (in SQL Server)

## Overview
This repository hosts an SQL script dedicated to the analysis of Cyclists, a Chicago bike-share company, launched in 2016. The project involves loading, preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing data of Cyclistic bikes between Member and Casual users during 2023. The goal is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclists bikes differently so that, in turn, the analytics team could design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

## About the Analysis
* The SQL script begins with the **Prepare Phase**, where data from different CSV files is loaded and inspected for structure and quality. 
* In the **Process Phase**, the data were merged into one dataset and undergoes cleaning, including the removal of missing values and duplicates, and transforming the data type of some columns, also additional columns were created.
* The **Analysis Phase** includes:
  * Calculating the total number of bike users also by bike type and bike preference.
  * Calculating the average ride duration between members and casual users.
  * Identifying the most popular start and end stations between user types. 
  * Calculating the number of riders by month from January to December of 2023.
  * Calculating the average number of rides by weekday and user type.
  * Calculating the average number of rides by start time and user type during a day.
* The **Visualization Phase** employs [Tableau Public Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Cyclistic2cleaneddata/CyclisticBike-Share?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to graphically represent the data and uncover trends over time.
* Finally, in the **Share and Act Phase** presented the **Findings**, **Conclusions** and **Recommendations** to the the Marketing Director of Cyclistic bike share Company.

## Results and Insights
* This project provided valuable insights of how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
* Key patterns and trends were identified, suggesting turning casual riders into annual members.
* Ultimately, several recommendations have been proposed to achieve this goal on turning the casual riders into annual members.
